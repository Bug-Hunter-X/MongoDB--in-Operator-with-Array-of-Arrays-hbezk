# MongoDB $in Operator with Array of Arrays
This repository demonstrates a common error when using MongoDB's `$in` operator with an array of arrays. The provided code example shows how an incorrect usage can result in unexpected query behavior. A corrected version is included to illustrate the correct approach.

## Bug Description
The `$in` operator is designed to match a field against any value within a provided array. However, when providing an array of arrays, it doesn't perform a nested comparison as one might intuitively expect. Instead, it attempts to match the entire array of arrays.  This often leads to zero results when a flat array was intended.

## Solution
The correct approach involves restructuring the input array into a single, flat array. This ensures that `$in` can function as intended, accurately matching documents where `field` is one of the values in the flat array.
